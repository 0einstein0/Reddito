# Oasis

Oasis is a **free, open-source, peer-to-peer social application** that helps
you follow friends and discover new ones on [Secure Scuttlebutt (SSB)][ssb].

**ü¶Ä Powered by SSB.**  
You're the center of your own distributed network. Online or offline, SSB works
anywhere that you are. Follow the people you want to see and never worry about
spam again. Migrate your data to another SSB app any time you want.

**üåê Bring your own browser.**  
Use your favorite web browser to read and write messages to the people you care
about. Oasis runs over HTTP, so you don't need to worry about adding another
Electron app to your computer.

**üè∞ Just HTML and CSS.**  
No browser JavaScript! Oasis has strict security rules that prevent any
JavaScript from running in your browser, which helps us make Oasis accessible
and easy to improve.

## Example

```sh
oasis
```

Use `oasis --help` to get configuration options. You can change the default
values with a custom [configuration](./docs/configuring.md).

## Installation

Most people should install stable releases with [npm](https://npmjs.org/) and
Node.js [**current** or **active LTS** release](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/).

For faster updates and less stability, install from GitHub and upgrade often.
