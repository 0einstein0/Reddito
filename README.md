# Oasis

Oasis is a **free, open-source, peer-to-peer social application** that helps you follow friends and discover new ones on [Secure Scuttlebutt (SSB)][ssb].

### ü¶Ä Powered by SSB

You're the center of your own distributed network. Online or offline, SSB works anywhere that you are. Follow the people you want to see and never worry about spam again. Migrate your data to another SSB app any time you want.

### üåê Bring your own browser

Use your favorite web browser to read and write messages to the people you care about. Oasis runs a small HTTP server on your own computer, so you don't need to worry about adding another Electron app to your computer.

### üè∞ Just HTML and CSS

No browser JavaScript! Oasis has strict security rules that prevent any JavaScript from running in your browser, which helps us make Oasis accessible and easy to improve.

## Example

After installing, launch Oasis from the command line by running:

```sh
oasis
```

It will then pop open a browser window for you.

Use `oasis --help` to get configuration options. You can change the default values with a custom [configuration](./docs/configuring.md).

## Installation

First, you'll need Node.js and npm on your computer. Run `node --version` to see if you have it. If not, or if it's older than the [**current** or **active LTS** version](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/), you should [download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/) first.

Then you can install the stable version of Oasis:

```shell
npm -g install fraction/oasis#semver:
```

Or, for faster updates and less stability, install Oasis from GitHub and upgrade often.

```shell
npm -g install fraction/oasis
```

Check out [`install.md`](https://github.com/fraction/oasis/blob/master/docs/install.md)
for more information.
